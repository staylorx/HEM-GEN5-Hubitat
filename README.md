# HEM-GEN5-Hubitat
Aeon Aeotec Home Energy Meter, Gen5 Hubitat Device Drive

This is a HEM Gen5 driver for the Hubitat hub. I've found a couple versions of this, and this version I've saved off has served me reasonably well. 

This driver is primarily aimed at supporting the syslog capabilities of the Hubitat device, and as a consequence, it doesn't need all the extra logging detail of the original driver.

The syslog driver I use and contribute to is here: https://github.com/hubitatuser12/hubitatCode

## Install

Copy and paste the entire contents from the drivers folder file into a new device driver in Hubitat.

Then change or update the driver for your HEM device.
